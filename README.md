## Description

On this website, you can register an account and book reservations to your favorites restaurants. After creating an account, you will be routed to the home page where you can view your current reservations or start a new search. At the restaurant search page, you enter your location, desired time, date and party size. A list of restaurants with availabilities will then generate and booking is only a click away!

To store user registration and reservation information, our team used Supabase. User, restaurant and reservation information was stored and the necessary information was displayed throughout Food Findr. Authentication was completed using passport.
